## ColText 
(One of the worst name which basically means color and text, based on the current features of this extension and in future the name will be changed.)

Using this extension you can test shades live on webpage and test different texts which suits the length of div's.
With this basic simple features, the motive is to reduce the number of switches between tabs and get a better comparison of shades.
